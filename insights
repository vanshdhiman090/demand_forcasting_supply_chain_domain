Plan inventory more efficiently, reducing both stockouts and overstock.

Lower operational costs by minimizing excess inventory and lost sales.

Support data-driven decisions for promotions and weekly planning.

adopting Prophet for weekly demand forecasting would enhance inventory management and improve overall profitability.
